Introduction : Bored Games is an application that includes mulitple different games such as Hangman, Trivia, Script Scavengers, and Sudoku. Bored Games is useful because it helps users pass time when they are bored and each of the games inside of the application are good for the user's brain and help them learn and keep their brain sharp.

Features : This application lets users create their profile and play games under that profile, the users can then track their scores and they can see how much they have improved during their time on the application.

Technologies : The technoligies that were used for Bored Games were Android Studio written in Java, and we tested the application on our Galaxy Tablet A8, the APIs that we used for the application are from a website called API Ninjas.

Installation : To install Bored Games you need to download the repository from the Bored Games Github and create an Android Studio project, once you cloned the repository you must plug in your tablet and then you are able to run the application on your tablet.

Development Settings : After downloading our repository the user needs to have an android tablet ready, once that tablet is ready they need to make sure the tablet is connected to wifi so the user can login or create an account, next on the tablet the user must go into their settings and go to the bottom where it says "About Tablet" once they are in that page they must click "Software Information" and then click "Build number 7 times. Once that is finished, a new tab will appear named "Developer Options, then scroll until you can see "USB Debugging" and toggle that on. Once all of this is setup the user can plug in their tablet and run the application.
